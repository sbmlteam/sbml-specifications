\section{Best practices}
\label{best-practices}

In this section, we recommend a number of practices for using and
interpreting various constructs in the \RenderPackage.
These recommendations are non-normative, but we advocate them strongly;
ignoring them will not render a model invalid, but may reduce
inter-operability between software and models.
