\abstract{ Computational models can help researchers to interpret data, understand biological functions, and make quantitative predictions.  The \textbf{S}ystems \textbf{B}iology \textbf{M}arkup \textbf{L}anguage (SBML) is a file format for representing computational models in a declarative form that different software systems can exchange.  SBML is oriented towards describing biological processes of the sort common in research on a number of topics, including metabolic pathways, cell signaling pathways, and many others.  By supporting SBML as an input/output format, different tools can all operate on an identical representation of a model, removing opportunities for translation errors and assuring a common starting point for analyses and simulations.  This document provides the specification for \emph{Release 2} of \emph{Version~2} of \emph{SBML Level~3 Core}.  The specification defines the data structures prescribed by SBML as well as their encoding in XML, the eXtensible Markup Language.  The design of \emph{Version 2} principally differs from \emph{Version 1} in allowing new MathML constructs, making more child elements optional, and adding identifiers to all SBML elements, instead of only selected SBML elements.  \emph{Release 2} corrects some errors and clarifies some ambiguities discovered in \emph{Release 1}.  This specification also defines validation rules that determine the validity of an SBML document, and provides many examples of models in SBML form.  Other materials and software are available from the SBML project website at \url{http://sbml.org/}.}
