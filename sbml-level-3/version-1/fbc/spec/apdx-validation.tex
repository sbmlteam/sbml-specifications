\section{Validation of SBML documents} \label{apdx-validation} 

\subsection{Validation and consistency rules} \label{validation-rules} 

This section summarizes all the conditions that must (or in some cases, 
at least \emph{should}) be true of an SBML Level~3 Version~1 model that 
uses the \FBCPackage. We use the same conventions as are used in the 
SBML Level~3 Version~1 Core specification document. In particular, there 
are different degrees of rule strictness. Formally, the differences are 
expressed in the statement of a rule: either a rule states that a 
condition \emph{must} be true, or a rule states that it \emph{should} be 
true. Rules of the former kind are strict SBML validation rules---a 
model encoded in SBML must conform to all of them in order to be 
considered valid. Rules of the latter kind are consistency rules. To 
help highlight these differences, we use the following three symbols 
next to the rule numbers: 

\begin{description} 

\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\vSymbol\vsp] A \vSymbolName indicates a 
\emph{requirement} for SBML conformance. If a model does not follow this 
rule, it does not conform to the Flux Balance Constraints specification. 
(Mnemonic intention behind the choice of symbol: ``This must be 
checked.'') 

\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\cSymbol\csp] A \cSymbolName indicates a 
\emph{recommendation} for model consistency. If a model does not follow 
this rule, it is not considered strictly invalid as far as the Flux 
Balance Constraints specification is concerned; however, it indicates 
that the model contains a physical or conceptual inconsistency. 
(Mnemonic intention behind the choice of symbol: ``This is a cause for 
warning.'') 

\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\mSymbol\msp] A \mSymbolName indicates a strong 
recommendation for good modeling practice. This rule is not strictly a 
matter of SBML encoding, but the recommendation comes from logical 
reasoning. As in the previous case, if a model does not follow this 
rule, it is not strictly considered an invalid SBML encoding. (Mnemonic 
intention behind the choice of symbol: ``You're a star if you heed 
this.'') 

\end{description} 

The validation rules listed in the following subsections are all stated 
or implied in the rest of this specification document. They are 
enumerated here for convenience. Unless explicitly stated, all 
validation rules concern objects and attributes specifically defined in 
the Flux Balance Constraints package. 

For \notice convenience and brevity, we use the shorthand 
``\token{fbc:\-x}'' to stand for an attribute or element name \token{x} 
in the namespace for the \FBCPackage, using the namespace prefix 
\token{fbc}. In reality, the prefix string may be different from the 
literal ``\token{fbc}'' used here (and indeed, it can be any valid XML 
namespace prefix that the modeler or software chooses). We use 
``\token{fbc:\-x}'' because it is shorter than to write a full 
explanation everywhere we refer to an attribute or element in the 
\FBCPackage namespace. 

\subsubsection*{General rules about this package} 

\validRule{fbc-10101}{To conform to the \FBCPackage specification for 
SBML Level~3 Version~1, an SBML document must declare the use of the 
following XML Namespace:\\ 
\textsl[-25]{\uri{http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/fbc/version1} 
}. (References: SBML Level~3 Package Specification for Flux Balance 
Constraints, Version~1, \sec{xml-namespace}.)} 

\validRule{fbc-10102}{Wherever they appear in an SBML document, elements 
and attributes from the \FBCPackage must be declared either implicitly 
or explicitly to be in the XML namespace 
\uri{http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/fbc/version1}. 
(References: SBML Level~3 Package Specification for Flux Balance 
Constraints , Version~1, \sec{xml-namespace}.) } 

\subsubsection*{General rules about identifiers} 

\validRule{fbc-10301}{(Extends validation rule \#10301 in the SBML 
Level~3 Version~1 Core specification.) Within a \Model the values of the 
attributes \token{id} and \token{fbc:\-id} on every instance of the 
following classes of objects must be unique across the set of all 
\token{id} and \token{fbc:\-id} attribute values of all such objects in 
a model: the \Model itself, plus all contained \FunctionDefinition, 
\Compartment, \Species, \Reaction, \SpeciesReference, 
\ModifierSpeciesReference, \Event, and \Parameter objects, plus the 
\FluxBound, \Objective and \FluxObjective objects defined by the 
\FBCPackage. (References: SBML Level~3 Package Specification for Flux 
Balance Constraints, Version~1, \sec{primtypes}.) } 

\validRule{fbc-10302} {

\subsubsection*{Rules for the extended \class{SBML} class} 

\validRule{fbc-20101}{In all SBML documents using the \FBCPackage, the 
\SBML object must include a value for the attribute 
\token{fbc:\-required} attribute. (References: SBML Level~3 Version~1 
Core, Section~4.1.2.) } 

\validRule{fbc-20102}{The value of attribute \token{fbc:\-required} on
